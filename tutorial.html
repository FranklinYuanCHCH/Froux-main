            <h1>Understanding the Rubik's Cube</h1><br>
            <p>
                Before you start solving, familiarize yourself with the cube:

Each face has nine stickers, and there are six faces.<br>
The center sticker on each face is fixed in place and defines that face's color.<br>
The goal is to get each face to have a single color.<br>

            <h1>Step 1: Solving the cross</h1> <br>
            <p>
                Begin with the white face (opposite the yellow) as it's the most common starting point:

Find the white center sticker (it doesn't move).<br>
Locate white edge pieces and position them so they form a "+" shape around the white center.<br>
Place the white edge stickers under the white center sticker, forming a cross.<br>

            <p>
                Now, fill in the white corners around the white cross:

Match the remaining white stickers on the edges with their corresponding side colors.<br>
Insert the white corner pieces into their correct positions. You might need to use specific algorithms to do this.<br>

            <h1>Step 3: Solve the F2L (first 2 layers)</h1> <br>
            <p>
                Focus on solving the first two layers simultaneously:

Look for pairs of edge and corner pieces that belong in the second layer.<br>
Position these pairs above their respective slots in the second layer.<br>
Use algorithms to insert these pairs into the second layer while keeping the white layer intact.<br>

            <h1>Step 4: Edge Orientation</h1> <br>
            <p>
                In this step, you orient all the last layer (top layer) edge pieces correctly:

Make sure the white cross on the bottom layer is still intact.<br>
Use algorithms to manipulate the last layer edges until they are oriented correctly. This means they should all have the same color facing up.<br>

            <p>
                Now, focus on the last layer corners:

Ensure the last layer edges are oriented correctly.<br>
Use algorithms to manipulate the last layer corners until they are oriented correctly. This means each corner should have the correct colors on top.<br>

            <h1>Step 6: Corner Permutation</h1> <br>
            <p>
                In this step, you'll permute the last layer corners, so they are in the correct positions:

Make sure the last layer corners are oriented correctly.<br>
Use specific algorithms to swap the corners until they are in their correct locations.<br>

            <p>
                Finally, you'll permute the last layer edges:

Verify that the last layer corners and edges are correctly placed.<br>
Use algorithms to swap the last layer edges until they are in their correct positions.

                Check your cube to ensure that all layers are solved. If any pieces are out of place, you might need to repeat the last two steps until the cube is solved.<br>

Congratulations! You've now solved the Rubik's Cube. Remember that practice makes perfect, and solving the cube might take some time and patience. Good luck!<br>
